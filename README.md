# ELEC3848 Final Project Code on Arduino MCU

Two applications selected by jump-wire in `app_init`
- `application/chassis`: for chassis control board
- `application/roboarm`: for roboarm control board 

Coding style is heavily inspired by and some modules are borrown from the projects below:  
- DJI Robomaster. RoboRTS-Firmware. [https://github.com/RoboMaster/roboRTS-Firmware/](https://github.com/RoboMaster/roboRTS-Firmware/)
- Jin Yushang. ELEC3442-Group-Project. [https://github.com/EricEricEricJin/ELEC3442-Group-Project-Plane/](https://github.com/EricEricEricJin/ELEC3442-Group-Project-Plane/)
